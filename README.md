# Android-Tap-Tap-Game
Tap-Tap is an android platform based game for English learners to test common vocabulary, spelling and grammar that appears in everyday English. I made this app during a 24 hour hackathon held at my college.

It has both single player and multiplayer game. In single player mode, it (game) detects player's skill level and evidently shows questions based on that.
